Tkx.pm
------

The Tkx module provides yet another Tk interface for Perl.  Tk is a GUI
toolkit tied to the Tcl language, and Tkx provides a bridge to Tcl that
allows Tk based applications to be written in Perl.

The main idea behind Tkx is that it is a very thin wrapper on top of
Tcl, i.e. that what you get is exactly the behaviour you read about in
the Tcl/Tk documentation with no surprises added by the Perl layer.
In order to use Tkx, you need to understand enough Tcl to be able to
read the documentation for Tcl/Tk and figure out how this maps to the
Tkx.  You will not need to write any Tcl code though, as all your GUI
work, including the creation of megawidgets can be done in Perl using
Tkx.

The benefit of this approach compared Nick Ing-Simmons's classic Tk.pm
module is that you can always use the latest features that Tk/Tcl
provides and that you can use Tcl's native megawidgets directly.
Tk.pm has stagnated recently because of the huge effort needed to port
it to run with newer versions of Tk.  The downside of the Tkx approach
is that you will need to know a bit about Tcl and that you have to
install Tcl/Tk on both your development and deployment systems.
Another downside is that you will not be able to use any of the Tk::
add-ons or megawidgets already present on CPAN.

Tkx is the toolkit used to implement the GUI frontends of ActiveState's
PDK tools.

In order to install Tkx, you will need to have Tcl/Tk-8.4 and perl-5.8
with the Tcl.pm module installed.  Installation otherwise follow the
normal drill:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
